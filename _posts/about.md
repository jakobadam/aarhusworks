# About

Hi, my name is Jakob. I’m an experienced and fast learning full stack
developer with experience in the whole web stack.

I’ve worked with web applications since 2006, and have over the years
gained a deep understanding of all moving parts. This makes me capable
of both grasping and developing complex systems anywhere in the stack,
from JavaScript down to the metal.

I’ve implemented algorithmic solutions to increase performance in GIS
systems, created JavaScript widgets, architected and implemented large
multi-server systems, and moved hardware between datacenters in the
back of a truck. Lately, I've been involved in several Angular based
projects.

I’m fluent in Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML and CSS. Have developed
and operated dozens of web-applications – but, technical stuff aside I
care most and foremost about creating well- designed and useful
products.
